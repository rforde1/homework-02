## Installation

1. Had to clone the repo from my Git Hub page and create my files and folders.
2. Download background-images from provided templage source and make a semantic html file. 
3. Created bootstrap and stylesheet links to customize my page based on Homework-1 style requirements (colors, font-styles, etc)
4. Used Lorem to give page more page length after styling to make sure all of my float filled their space properly. Also to see how well the text look  at mobile responisve widths. 
5. Used bootstrap to give nav bar then used style.css to overide Bootstrap code to make it more easier on the eyes.
6. Gave top and bottom borders in each section ( header, body, footer), then gave margins between each section for page space. 
7. Gave all nav links border-radius property, and hover color and background. 
8. Used media quieres to make page more responsive at different mobile lengths. It wasnt easy and probably the most frustrating part of this assignment. I wanted to make it look perfect on each mobile size, but it is not perfect on each once. I was pretty close though. Overall this was a very fun assignment and I enjoyed this learning experience.
